# HTML, CSS and jQuery Practice

### Create a table within a single CSS property using the tags below:

1. table: entire table defined
2. tr: table row
3. td: table data

The data in the table contains input types as buttons that are assigned values. Using the onClick event, this means that we are assigning an execution action after the button has been clicked. The actions will be separeated and defined as their own functions in a .js file we create. In the JavaScript file containing the functions for execution after a button is clicked, the .val() method is used to get the values of form elements such as input, select and textarea.

- We want to make sure the jQuery CDN is loaded into the <head> tag of the HTML file from [here](https://releases.jquery.com/).

- JavaScript is loaded in via 
``` <script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script> ```

- Font is loaded in the <head> of our html from Google Font API [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron).
